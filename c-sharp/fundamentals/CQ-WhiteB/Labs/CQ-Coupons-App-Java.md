#Objective
The objective of the following labs is to understand the  implementation of Continuous Quality (CQ) in a real scenario example in regards to continuously testing, finding and fixing defects during all phases of the development cycle. 

The labs focus on the following steps: 
1. Enabling **shift left testing** by implementing different type of tests. 
2. Enabling **Unit Tests** in the build pipeline to test small parts of the application easily. 
3. Adding **functional BDD tests** in the QA environment in the release pipeline. 
4. Adding **UI Tests** in the SIT environment in the release pipeline.

#Key takeaways
The Key takeaways of these labs are: 
	
- Enabling shift left testing using **Test Driven Development** for quality code and detect bugs earlier.
- Implementing search feature using **Behavior Driven development** and Test Driven Development approach.
- Understanding the importance and implementation of **functional and non-functional tests** like unit, integration, UI and performance tests.
