# Objective
The objective of the following labs is to understand the  implementation of Continuous Quality (CQ) in a real scenario example in regards to continuously testing, finding and fixing defects during all phases of the development cycle. 

The labs focus on the following steps: 
1. **Enabling shift left testing** by implementing different type of tests. 
2. E**nabling Unit Tests** in the build pipeline to test small parts of the application easily. 
3. Adding **functional BDD tests** in the QA environment in the release pipeline. 
4. Adding **UI Tests in the SIT environment** in the release pipeline.

# Key takeaways
The Key takeaways of these labs are: 
- **Enabling shift left testing** using Test Driven Development for quality code and detect bugs earlier.
- **Implementing search feature** using Behavior Driven development and Test Driven Development approach.
- Understanding the importance and implementation of functional and non-functional tests like **unit, integration, UI and performance tests**.
