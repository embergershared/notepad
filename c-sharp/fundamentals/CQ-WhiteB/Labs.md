# Continuous Quality with Bookings App

This demo is based on **SmartHotel360**, which is a fictitious smart hospitality company. Due to the complexity of managing the local infrastructure, SmartHotel360 wants to re-host their web app with minimal efforts in Azure.

**Role play scenario:** The lab continues on from where we've stopped in the role play scenario. The **Dev Lead now has to implement and revisit** some of the aspects that have come forward from the role play. 

**Context:** The testing team follow some testing scripts to **manually execute** some basic application functionality tests which causes many of tests to be inadvertently missed. Team turn-over is quite high because of huge **inter-dependency between Dev and Test teams** and repetitive nature of tasks.

**What :** Continuous quality is a **systematic approach** to finding and fixing software defects during all phases of the software development cycle. CQ **reduces** the **risk of security vulnerabilities and software defects (bugs)** by helping developers find and fix problems as early as possible in the development cycle. Continuous quality is part of a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) process.â€‹

**Why :** Testing provides a crucial way to get **fast feedback on the quality** of the system that is being build. By shifting left the efforts of testing also the cost of remediation for defects goes down significantly.   

**How :** Continuous Testing is defined as a software testing type that involves a process of **testing early, testing often, test everywhere, and automate.**
  
- **Unit testing** involves the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, being individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This should be automated as much as possible to help locate software defects promptly after the code is written and during build phase.

- **Integration Tests** should be driven by set of automated tests(UI, BDD) during release phases and immediately alert the team if modifications introduced have an unexpected or negative impact to the existing functionality.
